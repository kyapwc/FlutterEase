# hackathon_boilerplate

This is just a flutter boilerplate for the Flutter Hackathon KL 2019 @ Subang WORQ

## Vim users

Firstly, always ensure that you have these few plugins to develop faster on vim:

[Vim Flutter Plugin](https://github.com/thosakwe/vim-flutter)

[Vim Dart Plugin](https://github.com/dart-lang/dart-vim-plugin)

Vim Dart Plugin is necessary due to how syntax on dart works and *vim-flutter* just makes coding in vim so much more fulfilling!

## Getting Started

### IOS

If you are developing for IOS, ensure that you have the proper simulator (preferably *iPhone X^*) if you can.

Then run the command `flutter devices` to check if the simulator is on and ready to be used.

When simulator is ready, just run `flutter run` and your simulator should project your app inside

### Android
Developing for Android utilizes the same command. Just make sure that you have simulator/  devices attached (API 20 or above - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48802841/minimum-android-version-with-flutter).


# Bare Git Requirements

Please **ensure** that when creating PR (Pull Requests), make it named as such: `feature/<feature_name>`, this is to follow standard procedure and is good practice as well. In future if it is extended, we can have diff branch for `hotfix`, `release`, `develop`, `staging` and so on. So, all branch names have specific purpose.

Please also ensure that the branch names are written properly and not sloppily so reviewers can understand the context of the feature
