# FlutterEase

FlutterEase is built atop of social media platforms and social sharing platforms.

Examples of social media platforms include:-
- Facebook
- Instagram

Example of social sharing platforms:-
- Medium
- StackOverflow
- Dev.to
- TIL (Hashrocker, Kaiwern, Reddit)

The idea was to basically create a platform for users to be able to read any developer related news.

For example, the Top Posts would consist of posts regarding Flutter questions and tips & tricks.

An example of that could be: `What you didn't know about Flutter's Navigations!` or `How to set global keys?` and so on.

Posts would get `Upvotes` and that is judged by the community. The highest upvotes will make it to the Top Posts of the day.
